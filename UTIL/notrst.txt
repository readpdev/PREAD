                                     Message . . . . :   New format SPYDIR created for file SPYDIR.
                                     Cause . . . . . :   File SPYDIR was restored into library DIN870OBJ. However,
                                       a new format SPYDIR was created for the file because sharing of format
                                       SPYDIR with file SPYDIR in library EGARSKE could not be established again.
                                       The possible reasons are: 1) File SPYDIR in library EGARSKE using format
                                       SPYDIR with a correct format level identifier does not exist. 2) File SPYDIR
                                       in library DIN870OBJ using format SPYDIR with a correct format level
                                       identifier does  not exist. 3) The allocated length of a variable length
                                       field in one file does not match that of the other file. 4) One of the files
                                       has an identity column and the other file does not, or the identity column
                                       or an identity column attribute in one file does not match that of the other
                                       file. 5) One of the files has a row change timestamp and the other file does
                                       not, or the row change timestamp column or row change timestamp attribute in
                                       one file does not match that of the other file.

                                     Cause . . . . . :   An escape exception message was sent to a program which
                                       did not monitor for that message. The full name of the program to which the
                                       unmonitored message was sent is RSTVLPSAVF  . At the time the message was
                                       sent the program was stopped at higher level language statement number(s)
                                       2300. If more than one statement number is shown, the program was a bound
                                       program. Optimization does not allow a single statement number to be
                                       determined. If *N is shown as a value, it means the actual value was not
                                       available. Recovery  . . . :   See the low level messages previously listed
                                       to locate the cause of the function check.  Correct any errors, and then try
                                       the request again.

                                       The possible reasons are: 1) File HMAGHLP in library EGARSKE using format

                                       level identifier does  not exist. 3) The allocated length of a variable
